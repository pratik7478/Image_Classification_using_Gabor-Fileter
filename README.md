What is Image Classification?

Classification between objects is a fairly easy task for us, but it has proved to be a complex one for machines and therefore image classification has been an important task within the field of computer vision.
Image classification refers to the labeling of images into one of a number of predefined classes.
There are potentially n number of classes in which a given image can be classified. Manually checking and classifying images could be a tedious task especially when they are massive in number (say 10,000) and therefore it will be very useful if we could automate this entire process using computer vision.


# Firtly we have Scrapped the data and then applied the machine learing algorithm using gabor feature extraction
# Glob Library
Glob is a general term used to define techniques to match specified patterns according to rules related to Unix shell. Linux and Unix systems and shells also support glob and also provide function glob() in system libraries.

# gabor filter

We have used the gabor filter feature extraction of the images .

# To run the code 
i) extract the zip file first 
ii)give the proper path to train and test folder
